# FriendFinder
Welcome to the _**FriendFinder**_ app! 
FriendFinder is a friend-matching application that utilizes the user's responses to questionaire. The user responds to questions that have values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is submitted, the application checks the existing hard-coded friends API in order to return the match who has the lowest absolute difference when compared to the user's score.  

This app is deployed to Heroku, check it out [here](https://friendfinder5.herokuapp.com/) 
**Happy matching!**
